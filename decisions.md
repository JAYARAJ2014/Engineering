# 📊 Data-Driven Decision-Making Guide  
### For Engineers & Engineering Managers

Making decisions based on data—not assumptions, emotions, or opinions—leads to clarity, speed, and consistent progress.  
This guide helps teams adopt a practical, repeatable, and lightweight data-driven approach.

## 🔍 1. What Is Data-Driven Decision Making?

Data-driven decision making means:
- Collecting and analyzing the right data
- Using trends and patterns (not guesses or gut-feel)
- Making decisions with 60–70% clarity (not waiting for perfection)
- Measuring the impact after implementation
- Adjusting quickly based on new evidence

It is **not**:
- Blindly following dashboards  
- Analysis paralysis  
- Waiting for perfect data  
- Using data to justify a decision you already made

## 🧩 2. The Four Types of Data Used in Decisions

### **1. Quantitative Data (numbers, metrics)**
Examples:
- Sprint velocity  
- PR lead time  
- API latency  
- Defect counts  
- Server utilization  

### **2. Qualitative Data (feedback, interpretation)**
Examples:
- User interviews  
- Team feedback  
- Customer complaints  
- Retrospectives  

### **3. Leading Indicators (predict the future)**
Examples:
- Rising PR backlog → upcoming release delays  
- Increased incidents → architectural weaknesses forming  

### **4. Lagging Indicators (show what happened)**
Examples:
- Outages last quarter  
- Revenue last month  
- NPS from last release  

Good decisions usually blend **all four**.

## 🧠 3. A Simple 5-Step Data-Driven Decision Framework

### **Step 1: Define the Decision Clearly**
Ask:
- What decision am I trying to make?
- What problem am I solving?
- What does success look like?

### **Step 2: Identify the Minimum Data Needed**
Avoid data overload.  
Ask:
- What *minimum* data points directly influence this decision?
- What do we already have?
- What is missing?

### **Step 3: Pull & Analyze the Data**
Look for:
- Trends (Is it going up or down?)
- Comparisons (Before vs after, A vs B)
- Outliers (What’s unusual?)
- Patterns (What repeats?)

### **Step 4: Make the Decision**
Use:
- 60–70% clarity rule  
- Impact vs effort  
- Risk vs reward  
- Reversible vs irreversible decisions  

**Act → measure → adjust.**

### **Step 5: Measure the Outcome**
After rollout:
- Did metrics move in the expected direction?
- What surprised us?
- What should we adjust?

This creates a learning loop.

## 📐 4. Key Metrics Engineers & Managers Should Know

### **Delivery Metrics**
- **Cycle Time** — Start → Done  
- **Lead Time** — Request → Delivered  
- **Throughput** — Tickets completed per sprint  
- **WIP** — Work in progress  

### **Quality Metrics**
- **Escaped Defects**  
- **Flaky Tests**  
- **Code Coverage (interpreted carefully)**  
- **MTTR** (Mean Time To Recovery)  

### **Operational Metrics**
- **API p95 latency**  
- **Error rate**  
- **CPU/Mem**
